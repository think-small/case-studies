<h1>Clinical Chemistry - Case Studies</h1>

<p>
This app is designed to deliver case studies to students in a manner that simulates working with an electronic medical record (EMR) system. Students are required to review patient history, progress notes, manually orders tests, and review results in order to arrive at a probable diagnosis. They will be assessed on which tests they ordered, how many extra tests were performed, which results they deemed most significant, and which signs/symptoms they mark as most significant. Upon completion of each case study, students will be directed to an interactive page where they can further their learning about the disease state presented in the case study.
